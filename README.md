# heart-failure-prediction
AI/ML project on heart failure prediction using kaggle dataset with data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation done in google collab.

#  Heart Failure Prediction (AI/ML Workshop Project)

This project predicts the likelihood of **heart failure** using machine learning techniques on the [Kaggle Heart Failure Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction).  
The project was developed as part of an **AI/ML workshop assignment** using **Google Colab**.

---

##  Project Overview
- **Goal:** Predict whether a patient is at risk of heart failure.  
- **Dataset:** Contains 12 clinical features such as age, anaemia, blood pressure, smoking habits, and ejection fraction.  
- **Algorithms Used:**  
  - Logistic Regression  
  - Random Forest Classifier  

---

##  Results
- Logistic Regression achieved a good baseline accuracy.  
- Random Forest improved performance with better recall and F1-score.  
- Visualisations include correlation heatmaps, confusion matrix, and ROC curve.
